# API-Project

I used the API https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/2bh6-qmgg.json to create a bar chart and a line chart. In this project
I used an API to gather data and create 2 different charts to see if there were relationships between different grade levels, number levels they scored, gender, and years.
In the bar chart I wanted to see the relationship between the different grades of 3 through 8 who score a level 1 on their exam. As students 
get older they tend to not care as much about standardized testing, so I was looking to see if more students in grade 8 scored a level 1 compared 
to students in grade 3. For my line chart I was curious to see if males in all grades scored a level 4 on their exam as the years went on. 
Boys tend to not get as much attention when they are struggling in school, and this has been an increasingly talked about topic. I wanted to see if
as the years went on, more boys scored at a level 4 or not.
